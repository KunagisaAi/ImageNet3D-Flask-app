# ImageNet3D Flask app
## Notes on Using the Software and Solutions to Common Problems
### Packages to install before running the program:
    - Flask <br>
    - numpy <br>
    - matplotlib <br>
    - pillow <br>
    - opencv-python-headless <br>
    - flask-login <br>
    <br>
    When in use, a folder named "imagene3dstorage" will be created in the current directory.  <br>
    In the next-level directory of this folder, there will be an empty SQLite file with 0 bytes. <br>
    You can replace its content with that of the "daatabasse_default.ssqlite" file in the software's root directory to use it normally. <br>
    The software 'Navicat Premium' can be used for replacement. <br>
